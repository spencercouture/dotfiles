# README
The point of this repo is to import my preferred dev environment onto arbitrary machines. Currently this is highly focused to standard linux distros that support bash


# source our bash script from bashrc
```
cat >> ~/.bashrc << EOF
if [ -f ~/.bash_scripts.bash ]; then
  source ~/.bash_scripts.bash
fi
EOF
```
