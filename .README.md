# README
The point of this repo is to import my preferred dev environment onto arbitrary machines. Currently this is highly focused to standard linux distros that support bash

# Setup
Here are the steps you follow to get this repo setup and tracking properly on an arbitrary machine.

```
# Clone the repo into the `$HOME/.dotfiles` dir 
git clone --bare https://github.com/spencercouture/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
# (temporarily) setup our alias
alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME'
# Ignore untracked files
dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
# Checkout files (and resolve conflicts!)
dotfiles checkout
# (once conflicts are resolved/files are backed up, use --force)
```


# source our bash script from bashrc
```
cat >> ~/.bashrc << EOF
if [ -f ~/.bash_scripts.bash ]; then
  source ~/.bash_scripts.bash
fi
EOF
```

## NVIM prereqs
The provided NVIM config utilizes lazyvim, which is almost entirely self-contained. That being said, install the following:
```
build-essential
```

# install tpm for tmux
```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```
